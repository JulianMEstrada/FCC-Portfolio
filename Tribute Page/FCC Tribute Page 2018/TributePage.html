   <div class="subHeading"><strong>Who is Scott?</strong></div>
<p id="text"> 
Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi, better known by his stage name Kid Cudi, is an American recording artist and actor from Cleveland, Ohio. Cudi first gained major recognition following the release of his first official full-length project, a mixtape titled A Kid Named Cudi in 2008. The mixtape caught the attention of American rapper-producer Kanye West, who subsequently signed Cudi to his GOOD Music label imprint in late 2008. Cudi has since gone on to launch his own record label imprints, the now-dissolved Dream On and current independent label Wicked Awesome Records.</p>
  <div class="subHeading"><strong>Influence</strong></div>
<p id="text">Kid Cudi has gone on to influence and inspire multiple artists himself, such as rappers Kanye West,Travis Scott,Kendrick Lamar,Schoolboy Q,Chance the Rapper,Childish Gambino,Logic,ASAP Rocky,ASAP Nast,Allan Kingdom,Raury,Key!,Kevin Abstract, and Jaden Smith, as well as singers Jhene Aiko, Lissie and Tinashe, among others. In a 2010 interview with Billboard, Kanye West called Cudi his "personal favorite artist in the world right now. His whole take on the game is just unfiltered, uncensored artistry." In a 2015 article titled "KiD CuDi - A Forgotten Influence on Psychedelic Introspection in Hip-Hop", the author wrote "Cudi helped bring about a new era of electronic, psychedelic driven production. And his dark, drug-riddled approach to introspection has already taken hold in the up-and-comers in the hip-hop world."
In 2016, Kanye West called Cudi "the most influential artist of the past 10 years". West Coast hip hop duo Audio Push also praised Cudi in 2016, saying "The thing I love about Cudi is he's unapologetically real. He birthed so much of, not even the new generation of artists, but a lot of [your] favorite artists wouldn't be [your] favorite artists if it wasn't for Cudi." In November 2016, Atlanta-based rapper OG Maco, who has cited Cudi as a major influence on several occasions,[236] released an EP titled For Scott, as a tribute to Kid Cudi.Publications such as HotNewHipHop, DJBooth and IBTimes have all noted Cudi's influence on contemporary hip hop, since his breakthrough in 2008.
 <div class="subHeading"><strong>Musical Style</strong></div>
<p id="text">Kid Cudi's musical style has been described as "an atmospheric take on melodic rap, with a dollop of charming, off-key singing". He has also been called "introspective, with the ability to lay his insecurities on record and expose his fallibility." In 2015, Kris Ex of Billboard, wrote "he's always been an emotional artist, dealing with expansive and nebulous feelings in acute and often destructive ways." Kid Cudi's sound is what inspired and led Kanye West to create his cathartic 808s & Heartbreak, with West later stating that he and Cudi were "the originators of the style, kinda like what Alexander McQueen is to fashionâ€¦. Everything else is just Zara and H&M." West also complimented Cudi by saying, "His writing is just so pure and natural and important." In March 2014, Cudi talked about wanting to provide guidance for young listeners with his music: "my mission statement since day one... all I wanted to do was help kids not feel alone, and stop committing suicide."
Kid Cudi's music has also been described as trip hop. Furthermore, he is known for harmonizing and humming in his music, which helps formulate his signature sound. On 2011's WZRD and 2015's Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven, Cudi incorporated the use of screamed vocals, and can be heard yodeling on his 2016 album Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin'. Throughout the years he has also incorporated elements of psychedelia, R&B, electronica, synthpop and grunge, in his music.
